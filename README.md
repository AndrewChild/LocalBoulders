 Framework for building bouldering guidebooks

# TODO:
	Python:
	- Add area maps feature
	- Intro?
	- gps coords for boulders
	- use of cammal case vs other conventions is inconsistent
	- PEP8?
	- is there a more elegant way to move through the data stucrue (e.g. reference grandchildren and grandparents in addition to parents and children, book.boulders or boulders.book)
	- move LaTeX specific stuff to its own folder/project
	- remove metaclasses
    - use itertools.count for indexing
    - instead of assigning topos to boulders assign them to their lowest numbered route
    - limit photo height
    LaTeX:
    - GPS index of boulders
    - arete shortcut
    - support half and full page photo sizes
    - there seems to be no way to include a full page photo on the first page of a chapter
    Other:
    - Consider alternatives to LaTeX. HTML?
    - documentation
