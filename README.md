 Framework for building bouldering guidebooks

# TODO:
	Python:
	- Add area maps feature
	- Intro?
	- gps coords for boulders
	- use of cammal case vs other conventions is inconsistent
	- Area histograms
	- PEP8?
	LaTeX:
	- index formatting will break if a route name (or other item) is too long
    - GPS index of boulders
    - arete shortcut
	- add colaborators page
    - support half and full page photo sizes
    - there seems to be no way to include a full page photo on the first page of a chapter
	Other:
	- Consider alternatives to LaTeX. HTML?
